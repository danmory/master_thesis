Missing:
1. if lessor is SC then payRent may not always work due to gas limits. Maybe require block?
2. No methods for "The lessor shall provide at least 30 days' notice before termination, unless breach occurs."
3. `terminateAgreement` does not count for lessee
4. No checks that payment is monthly.
